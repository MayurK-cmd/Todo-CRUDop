CRUD Operations Explained

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Deleteâ€”the four basic operations of persistent storage in databases and APIs.

1.Create: Adds new data to the database, often through forms or API endpoints. This corresponds to the HTTP POST method.

2.Read: Retrieves data from the database, typically using queries. This is mapped to the HTTP GET method.

3.Update: Modifies existing data in the database, usually identified by an ID. This operation aligns with the HTTP PUT or PATCH methods.

4.Delete: Removes data from the database, which is associated with the HTTP DELETE method.

These operations form the backbone of most applications, enabling dynamic data interaction and management.

To-Do Application with CRUD Operations

A To-Do application is a classic example of CRUD in action:

1.Create: Add new tasks to your to-do list.
2.Read: View all your tasks to see what's pending or completed.
3.Update: Edit tasks, such as changing the title, due date, or marking them as done.
4.Delete: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
By using CRUD operations, a To-Do app helps keep your tasks organized and manageable, making it a perfect tool for productivity!
